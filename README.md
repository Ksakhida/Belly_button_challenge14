# Belly_button_challenge14

This project is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Features

- Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual.
- Bubble chart to display each sample.
- Display of individual demographic information.
- Dynamic updates when a new sample is selected.

## Note
I have used the 'console-log' function at each step to see the structure of the data at each step.

Thank you.
